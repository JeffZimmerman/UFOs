# UFOs

## Project Overview
This aim of this project was to create an interactive webpage allowing for user inputs into various search criteria to access data on reported UFO sightings. Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap elements were brought together to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

### Results
Familar website elements are brought together, including a navigation bar, main header, description of the site, and text entry boxes that affect the main content portion of the page. Background formatting provides a visually appealing color scheme relevent to the subject, including use of NASA imagery and light-colored text on a dark background, like one might experience when encountering unidentifed bright lights in a night sky. Flexible containers were used to hold textual elements, and each portion of the page was organized according to a storyboard-format, allowing users of different sized-screens to still enjoy the intended design presentation.

> The initial page offers multiple entry points: The user can begin by reading the overview paragraph, browse the default data presented, or by filtering a search: >

The webpage acheieved its primary aim of dynamic responsiveness to user inputs. The user can search for reported UFO sightings in the dataset by date, city, state, country, and the "shape" of the unidentified object that was seen. The main content portion of the page responds and rapidly filters based on each individual input, allowing the user to quickly backtrack or alter their search criteria based on the results shown.

### Summary
The project achieves the goal of providing easily accessible and dynamically searchable information on reported UFO sightings. The table filters allow the user to quickly move from a broad search to one that is more focused, and
